## Project #1: Hackathon

<!-- Give a high-level overview of the project purpose -->

Link: https://github.com/yhakeem/hackathon.git

- **What are the users?**: Users are anyone who is curious about which technology career best suits their personality.
- **What job does it form for them?**: Provides employment and salary information so that users can explore career options.
- **What inspired you to make it?**: I was inspired by my own journey into the technology field. When I initially decided to change careers I was only familiar with software development, over time I learned about other roles including UX/UI design, project management, product owner, scrum master etc. This personality quiz is a way to see what tech career path is best for you.
- **What features are the most important?**: The graphical user interface (GUI)is the most important because it's how questions are viewed and answered.
