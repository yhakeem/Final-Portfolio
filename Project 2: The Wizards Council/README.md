## Project #2: The Wizards Council(backend)
<!-- Give a high-level overview of the project purpose -->
Link:https://github.com/yhakeem/The-Wizards-Council.git

- **What are the users?**: Users are people who are passionate about wizardry and interested in collecting their favorite spells.
- **What job does it form for them?**: This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete their favorite spells.
- **What inspired you to make it?**: My team was inspired to create The Wizards Council application based on one of our member's interest in the magical world of wizardry.
- **What features are the most important?**: The feature I would consider the most important is the authentication, authorization, and password hashing as it makes this website safe and secure, and allows for different permissions based on roles.

<!-- Script:  The second project I would like to talk about is a back end group project that I worked onw ith a team of dilligent new softwasre developers. The wizards counil is a application that allows new users to sign up as wizards and create, read, update, and delete their favorite spells based on their authorizations. This project dicrectly corresponds to job function 3 Apply the process of server-side development, including explaining algorithms, logic and data structures, can develop and maintain databases and codebases, and explain and implement APIs. During thsi proejct i specifically was reposnbil for creatin the sequelize models, hashing user passwords, and authenticating users. I also had the opportunity to rpactice with using relational data bases as both wizards and spells had related data.     -->
