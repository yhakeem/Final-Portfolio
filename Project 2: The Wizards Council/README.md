- **What are the users?**:
- **What job does it form for them?**:
- **What inspired you to make it?**: I was inspired by my own journey into the technology field. When I initially decided to change careers I was only familiar with software development, overtime I learned about other roles including UX/UI design, project managment, product owner, scrum master etc. This personality quiz is a way to see what tech career path is bestfor you. 
- **What features are the most important?**:The graphical user interface (GUI)is the most important because its how questions are viewed and answered.
