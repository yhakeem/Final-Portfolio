## Project #3
<!-- Give a high-level overview of the project purpose -->
Link: https://github.com/yhakeem/Movie-Api.git

- **What are the users?**: Users are individuals who are interested in watching movie reels.
- **What job does it form for them?**: It creates a one-stop show to view new and old movie trailers.
- **What inspired you to make it?**: My group was inspired to create this project by thinking of the type of API we would commonly use in our personal life. We all have seen movies before and have been interested in watching reels so we thought it would be a great way to apply what we've learned in class.
- **What features are the most important?**: The most important feature is the UI with data nicely organized so that users can consume and interact with it. The second most important feature is the application's ability to fetch data from the API and display it nicely using a CSS Framework of styled Components.
